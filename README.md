The information about the project experimentation with task can be found here: https://api.wandb.ai/links/counterfactuals/5gjwu6xk

The files in the repository contain the following:

1. `sae_eraser.ipynb` contains all the main coding in the project including the code of masks and model. 
2. `sae_eraser copy.ipynb` contains the code for dummy model, to ensure that the model runs (not to be engaged in).
3. `main.py` contains the code for experimentation on the mnist dataset for concept eraser. We tried to erase different digit information in the mnist dataset.
