Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
  0%|       | 0/282 [00:00<?, ?it/s]You're using a GPTNeoXTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
